In Progress: I am practicing the implementation of certain Linux/Command Line
programs in this repository.

This repository may also contain programs relevant to networks,
but it should be noted that I have a separate network-programs
repository.

Note for wget: argv[1] is the server name (IE www.google.com or www.nyu.edu), argv[2] is the servername+path to file
(IE www.something.com/hello/world/index.html).
